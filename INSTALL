Steps to install the postconfirm frontend to mailman.  Tested with exim4, but should
work with any mail agent which accepts sendmail style alias files with pipe
redirection.

1. Unpack the tarball.  Check the installation locations in 'Makefile',
   in particular the settings for 'prefix' and 'shared'.  Also check
   the settings in 'postconfirm.conf'; the install: target of 'Makefile'
   assumes that the paths in the config file will be used.  If you want
   things placed in other locations, you may have to change the settings
   for 'prefix' and 'shared' in 'Makefile', and you may even have to
   edit the lines of the 'install::' recipe.  When satisfied, run

	make
	make install

2. Place the 'wrapper' script in a directory of your choice, for instance
   /usr/local/postconfirm, and create a symlink to it named 'mailman' in
   the same directory.  Then edit the WRAPPER_DIR variable in
   /etc/mailman/mm_cfg.py to reflect the directory you placed the script
   in.  ('make install' will install 'wrapper' in /usr/share/postconfirm,
   and install a link 'mailman' in the same directory.  If this suits you,
   and you don't want to make any tweaks to 'wrapper', you can set
   WRAPPER_DIR in /etc/mailman/mm_cfg.py to "/usr/share/postconfirm" directly.

3. Edit the configuration variables of the wrapper script from 1. above so
   that the FILTER_BIN and MAILMAN_BIN variables reflect the correct paths for
   your system.

4. Edit /etc/postconfirm.conf (or /etc/postconfirm/postconfirm.conf) to fit
   your system.

5. Start the postconfirm daemon by hand ('sudo /usr/share/postconfirm/postconfirmd')
   or by running the init script 'sudo /etc/init.d/postconfirmd start'
