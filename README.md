# Postconfirm

Postconfirm is a front-end to mailing lists providing a subset of the functionality of TDMA, but streamlined and adapted to high-volume usage.

In 2024, postconfirm was refactored to separate the above functionality from the dmarc related rewriting that had been added over time. The code before this refactor is available in the `combined_challenge_and_rewrite` branch.
