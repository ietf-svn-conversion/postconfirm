postconfirmd (0.24)

  * Tweaked the log messages to give more information when a confirmation
    fails due to hash mismatch

  * Added regex whitelists.  These are *much* more costly than regular
    whitelist entries, so should be used sparingly.

  * Use a blank subject line if there is no Subject: header in the message,
    rather than throwing an exception.

  * Tweaked log messages so that where empty addresses can occur, they
    are enclosed in <>.  Also some other log message tweaks.

  * Added case normalization: white- and black-lists are normalized when
    read, and sender addresses are normalized when compared with white-
    and black-lists, but otherwise left untouched.  This means that the
    confirmed file can still contain mixed-case addresses, for instance.

  * Added a check for the sender to be somebody before doing the other
    confirmation verification checks.

  * Added blacklists (entries on these will never receive confirmation
    requests, so messages from them will just sit in the cache till they
    are removed by whatever periodic cache cleanout is implemented.

  * The internal sighup to re-read files did not go to the right process.
    Fixed; confirmations are now picked up and remembered on the next
    socket-handler process fork.

  * Some mailers apparently will break contigous non-whitespace character
    sequences in order to limit the lenght of header lines; this has the
    effect of inserting tabs or spaces in the confirmation hash or ID.
    Now deleting all embedded spaces in the confirmation subject components.

postconfirmd (0.21)

  * wrapper: Updated the mailman wrapper script to not drop messages if the
    postconfirmd daemon is not running, or gives an error return different
    from the error code 1 which signifies that a confirmation request was
    sent.

  * sendmail.py: Stopped logging mail sending

  * service.py: Changed the confirmation subject pattern to accept 822 lines
    broken across lines.

  * service.py: Added SIGHUP handling, so a HUP will cause the daemon to re-
    read the whitelist and confirmed files

  * service.py: Short-circuited responses to blank and self.  No need to try
    to send out those.

  * Re-worked some of the logging, to make it more succinct.

  * Moved service setup to after the daemonization, to make the sighup handler
    available in the right process.

  * Took out the prerequisites part of the Makefile.  AMS is not running Debian,
    anyway, so this will not work anyhow.

postconfirmd (0.20)

  * First released version.
    Known weaknesses:

       - Very limited installation instructions
       - Manpage needs elaboration
       - make install has a number of hard-coded paths, even if the
         daemon code has configuration variables which permit different
         installation
       - no make config, no automake support, not anything fancy to
         permit installation on different unices
