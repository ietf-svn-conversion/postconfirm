postconfirmd (0.20)

  * First released version.
    Known weaknesses:

       - Very limited installation instructions
       - Manpage needs elaboration
       - make install has a number of hard-coded paths, even if the
         daemon code has configuration variables which permit different
         installation
       - no make config, no automake support, not anything fancy to
         permit installation on different unices
