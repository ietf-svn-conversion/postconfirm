postconfirmd (0.21)

  * wrapper: Updated the mailman wrapper script to not drop messages if the
    postconfirmd daemon is not running, or gives an error return different
    from the error code 1 which signifies that a confirmation request was
    sent.

  * sendmail.py: Stopped logging mail sending

  * service.py: Changed the confirmation subject pattern to accept 822 lines
    broken across lines.

  * service.py: Added SIGHUP handling, so a HUP will cause the daemon to re-
    read the whitelist and confirmed files

  * service.py: Short-circuited responses to blank and self.  No need to try
    to send out those.

  * Re-worked some of the logging, to make it more succinct.

  * Moved service setup to after the daemonization, to make the sighup handler
    available in the right process.

  * Took out the prerequisites part of the Makefile.  AMS is not running Debian,
    anyway, so this will not work anyhow.

postconfirmd (0.20)

  * First released version.
    Known weaknesses:

       - Very limited installation instructions
       - Manpage needs elaboration
       - make install has a number of hard-coded paths, even if the
         daemon code has configuration variables which permit different
         installation
       - no make config, no automake support, not anything fancy to
         permit installation on different unices
