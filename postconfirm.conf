# whitelist regexes, one entry per line.  These files are not modified.  One
# entry in these files is *much* more costly than an entry in the plain
# whitelist files, so use with caution.  Only lowercase versions of addresses
# will ever be tested against the regexes, so you don't need to write them to
# match both lower-, upper- and mixed-case addresses.  The regexes shouldn't
# start with ^ and end with $; but these will be assumed.  In other words,
# only complete matches against sender addresses will be accepted.
