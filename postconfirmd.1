.SH NAME
\fBpostconfirmd \fP- Mail confirmation system (daemon part)
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

\fBpostconfirmd\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP]
.fam T
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpostconfirmd\fP is the long-running (daemon) part of a client-server
program which handles email confirmations. It is intended as a
front-end to mailing lists. It provides funcitonality which is a
subset of TMDA, but is adapted to high-volume usage and does not have
anywhere near all the bells and whistles which TMDA has. On the other
hand, since the whitelist lookup is done by the long-running server
part, the overhead of doing a verification that a poster has a
confirmed address is much smaller than for TMDA.
